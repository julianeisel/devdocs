This is the Blender Developer Handbook. It tries to provide all the necessary general information needed to develop Blender. As such it is not only aimed at beginner developers. It's also the hub for a lot of information for experienced developers.

> WARNING: __Proof of Concept__
> The entire structure of the handbook is just another proof of concept. Pages are empty or don't even exist. So 404 errors when navigating through pages are expected.
