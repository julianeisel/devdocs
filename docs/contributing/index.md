# Contribute Documentation

This documentation is built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). This provides a simple developer-oriented workflow with the familiar Markdown language for writing.

You can conveniently edit files via Gitea and submit the changes for review, or [build a local version](building.md) of the full documentation for off-line editing.
